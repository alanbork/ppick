.SH NAME
.B ppick
\-- a simple, curses-based interactive utility for picking one of a number of things at the terminal

.SH SYNOPSIS
<something> | ppick [OPTIONS...]
.PP
ppick [OPTIONS...] -l THING [THINGS...]
.PP
ppick -i [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [ARGUMENTS...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ppick is a simple, curses-based interactive utility for picking one of a number
of things.  By default THINGS are read from STDIN via a pipe. With -i the THINGS are provided on the command line.
THINGS are displayed full-screen, one per line.

To pick something, just start typing characters; only entries containing those characters are displayed.
Matching is smartcase, and uses fnmatch(3).  This differs from the well-known pick command in that matches
are not fuzzy, resulting in fewer extrainous matches.  You may also use the arrow keys etc.

Use ENTER to exit, writing the selected element (the one at the top of the
list) to standard output.  You can also exit (and fail) using either ESCAPE,
Control-C or qq.  You never search for two consecutive q characters,
right?

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
- [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGUMENTS...]
read things from standard input seperated by new lines, and execute the indicated command with the selected thing as an additional argument

.TP
-w 
read things from the standard input, seperated by whitespace (eg 1 2 3 gives 3 things)
.TP
- [OPTIONS] -l <THINGS>
read things from the command line (seperated by whitespace)

.TP
-p TEXT
prepend TEXT to the fnmatch pattern (the default is "*")

.TP
-s TEXT
append TEXT to the fnmatch pattern (the default is "*")

.TP
-P
do not prepend anything to the fnmatch pattern

.TP
-S
do not append anything to the fnmatch pattern

.TP
-f TEXT
set your favourite text; then, hitting the ";" key adds your favourite text to the current query

.TP
-Q
disable the feature whereby two consecutive q characters exits

.TP
-h
output a help message

.SH SEE ALSO

ppick is based on tpick, but with different scrolling, much faster screen updates, and some otehr small UI changes. tpick is similar to slmenu(1), and is also similar to dmenu(1) (although for the terminal, of course). ppick differs from pick in that the filter is not matched in a fuzzy fashion. 

.SH EXIT STATUS
ppick yields an exit status of 0 if a thing was successfully picked, and something else otherwise.
